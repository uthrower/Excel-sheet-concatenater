# Excel-sheet-concatenater
Concatenating excel files under the same folder, with the freedom of:
- concatenating into different files based on **user-defined grouping** (such as file styles/formats)
- **cherry-picking** the files/sheets required and ignore the irrelevant ones - based on user input!
- indexing your data to differentiate them by source file

Files under \to_combine folder are used for demonstration in jupyter notebook.
